 <p> 
    Whether it's the mystery around the little old man or the music of the giant doll, Squid Game has taken over the screens of people all over the world. With such success and repercussion, Netflix announced that the series was watched by 111 million viewers and consecrated the production as the biggest release of the platform.

    On October 1st, one of Netflix's CEOs and Director of Content, Ted Sarandos revealed that Squid Game was number 1 in every country, and with that, it would definitely be the biggest non-English language show in the world. .

            Squid Game tells the story of desperate people, who agree to participate in mysterious games in exchange for a cash prize.  It wasn't easy to bring that to the screen. The production took a whole decade to get off the ground.

    The creation process was quite long and difficult for Hwang Dong-hyuk, creator and director of Squid Game. He started writing the series in 2008, after conceiving the idea. At the time, he frequented comic book stores. Reading the comics, he came up with the idea of ​​creating something like a graphic novel set in Korea. Anyway, in 2009, he finished the script. At the time, as a film director, Hwang was thinking of making a film.

    But he had to file the idea, still in 2009. The director amended successful works, with the films 'Silenced' (2011), 'Miss Granny' (2014) and 'The Fortress' (2017). “The story seemed very different and violent for the time. Some considered the premise too complex and difficult to sell. I didn't get enough investment and scaling the cast was difficult. I stayed in this process for about a year, but I had to leave everything aside”, he said.

    Finally, ten years after writing the screenplay, Hwang Dong-hyuk managed to put the idea into practice. According to him, Netflix gave him total creative freedom to work 'Round 6' as he wanted. So he seized the opportunity and expanded the story, turning what would be a movie into a series.
