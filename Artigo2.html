    <h1> Which is the best reinforcement ? </h1>

 <div class="start">

 <p> 
     In recent months, the soccer market has become quite busy and talked about in Brazil.
</p>

         The country's teams, as well as Corinthians, brought in well-known reinforcements in the football field.
        Names such as Andreas Pereira, Diego Costa, Douglas Costa, Kennedy and Willian returned to Brazilian football after visiting Europe. 
        Of the players mentioned, however, Douglas Costa is the one who has been 'disappointing' for Grêmio in the Brazilian Championship.
        With a history full of injuries, the player has not yet been able to demonstrate his best qualities since returning to the club from Rio Grande do Sul.
         In 14 games played, so far, has not registered any goals or assists.

        During the program 'Jogo Aberto', on Band TV, commentator Denilson compared the hiring of Willian with that of Douglas Costa, but pointed out that the Corinthians reinforcement should add more, as the player "seems to be more physically prepared”.
        “The issue of Douglas Costa, the team doesn't help much either.
        </p>

        Grêmio's situation forces this issue even further. Willian, on the other hand, seems to be more physically prepared and the moment and situation for Corinthians is much more favorable for him to be able to play at his best and add even more to the Corinthians squad.”
        Willian, it's worth remembering, hasn't played since May, but played the entire European pre-season with Arsenal, from England. Therefore, he has been physically preparing himself to be able to return to the pitch and make his debut at the Parque São Jorge club.
