    <h1> Special : 31 Years of Back to the Future </h1>

 <div class="start">

 <p> 
    Back to the Future is one of the best movies of the 80's and is still a very watched movie today, largely because of its theories with the times we live. Robert Zemeckis (film producer) brings us one of the funniest films in cinema, of course, brushes up on physics, but takes it all in fun, it's a film without a big message but that's not why it's empty, like a cinematographic work It has everything: Screenplay, Soundtrack, Photography, editing, mixing. Starting with the screenplay that deals with time travel in an extremely simple, light and fun way, and oddly enough, it is complete, leaves nothing to be desired, everything is very well resolved and the characters are all very well developed, besides leaving that good hook in a natural way. Another big point is Alan Silvestre's soundtrack, it's epic and dictates the sound of the movie, and all the other soundtracks in the movie are unique, completely 80s, just like the grayish photography. Next, we will make a comparison between the films in the trilogy.

    <h1> Comparison: </h1>

    <p>
        In Back to the Future, the scenes at the end of the first film and the beginning of the second are the same. However, the actress who plays Jennifer Parker, the protagonist's girlfriend, Marty McFly needed to be replaced. The role of Jennifer in part 1 was played by Claudia Wells and in the sequel by actress Elisabeth Shue. With the change, the image sequence had to be redone. Despite the effort to make the remake as close to the original as possible, some curious differences emerged. The first movie brings us a lot of things from the time like cars, technology from that time and etc... Back to the Future I is the most loved movie by audiences compared to the second movie in the trilogy. Even so, many critics prefer D and Back to the Future II as the second film brings us a vision of what the future would be like, being very creative. An example of their creativity is the prediction that in 2015 we would already have flying cars.
