    <h1> eFootball 2022 vs PES 2021, which one has better graphics?  </h1>

 <div class="start">

 <p> 
    eFootball PES 2021, a title much better finished than eFootball 2022. The first thing that strikes you is that we have a graphics engine change.  In eFootball 2022, 4K is not achieved on any console.</p>

</div>

 <p>

    Another element where PES 2021 wins is in the recreation of characters from the public. The detail of the animations, illumination on the face, hair and physical behavior has also changed, with points in favor for both titles. The textures are also clearly superior in PES 2021, with much developed details.

<div class="textos"> 

 <p>  The conclusion that we can reach with this version of eFootball 2022 (it will be updated in November with new content and improvements) is that it is well below PES 2021. Konami has already warned that, out of the box, it would be a kind of demo.

        The result, however, is far below what is desired. Bugs are a constant and Konami has already apologized.
